## Overview

Sorting Visualizer is a web application that allows users to visualize various sorting algorithms in action. It provides a graphical representation of how different sorting algorithms work and how they rearrange elements in an array to sort them.

The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and visually appealing user experience. Users can select from a list of sorting algorithms and adjust the speed of the visualization to observe how the algorithm performs.
